I'm a PhD student in Computer Science advised by [Enrique Dunn](https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~edunn/) at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/). My research is focusing on 3D Dynamic Reconstruction problem given a set unsynchronized 2D observations without global sequencing information.
